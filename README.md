# Application of an inertial navigation system from IMU data

**The Inertial Navigation System (INS) exploits the information from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors to generate comprehensive and continuous navigational data, providing position awareness without any reliance on external devices**.  
Numerous instances of terminology misnomers can be found in the literature when comparing IMU and INS as if they were the same.

  The IMU provides raw acceleration and rotational data obtained from a set of accelerometers and gyroscopes mounted along orthogonal axes.  
*In order to provide even more accurate information, redundant sensors are often employed in IMUs. This typically involves the use of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes (e.g., 12 accelerometers and 12 gyroscopes) to enhance accuracy and reliability.*  
    
**This GitHub project focuses on the algorithmic part of the INS from pre-existing IMU data.** [IMU_data.mat](https://github.com/RodolpheFmd/Inertial-Navigation-System/blob/main/IMU_data.mat)
